# Cyber Lab Projects

This repository showcases a collection of hands-on cybersecurity projects, investigations, and real-world scenario-based investigations built using multiple security tools.
These exercises are designed to simulate SOC-level analysis, threat detection, incident response using a wide range of tools and techniques.

- **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tools** such as YARA, OpenCTI, and MISP
- **Network intrusion detection** using Snort, including live and offline packet analysis, anomaly detection, and custom rule creation
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** platforms like Splunk and the Elastic Stack (ELK)
- **Network traffic analysis**, **endpoint monitoring**, and **digital forensics**
- **Phishing analysis** and **incident response analysis** toolkits


Each folder contains a self-contained case study or lab simulation, complete with logs, queries, dashboards, and evidence artifacts. 
The repository features diverse attack scenarios and a wide variety of captured network traffic for realistic threat analysis.


More scenarios and tool integrations will be added as the lab evolves.
